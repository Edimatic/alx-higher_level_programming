						 Python - Everything is object
						===============================

The phrase "Python - Everything is an object" refers to a fundamental concept in the Python programming language. In Python, almost everything is treated as an object, including basic data types like integers, floats, and strings, as well as more complex data structures, functions, and even classes.


			Here are some key points that elaborate on this concept:

Objects in Python:
In Python, an object is a runtime instance of a class. Everything in Python is an object, and each object has a type (class) and data associated with it.


Data Types as Objects:
Simple data types, such as integers, floats, and strings, are also objects in Python. They have associated methods and attributes.


Functions as Objects:
Functions in Python are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values. Functions are also objects.


Attributes and Methods:
Objects in Python can have attributes (characteristics) and methods (functions that operate on the object). Even basic data types have associated methods.


Dynamic Typing:
Python is dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. Variables can change types, and objects can be reassigned to different variables.


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it supports object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Classes and objects are central to Python's OOP paradigm.


Memory Management:
Objects in Python are managed by the memory manager. When an object is created, memory is allocated, and when it is no longer needed, the memory is automatically reclaimed through the process of garbage collection.


The concept of "Python - Everything is an object" highlights the consistency and flexibility of Python's design, where everything, regardless of its complexity, is treated as an object with associated behavior and characteristics.
