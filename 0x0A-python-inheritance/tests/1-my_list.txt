The Public Instance Method
-------------------------

MyList Class Implementation Workflow

1. **Class Definition:**
   - Create a new Python file (e.g., 0-my_list.py) to define the `MyList` class.
   - Inherit from the built-in `list` class to create the custom list class.

2. **Instance Method: print_sorted:**
   - Add a public instance method `print_sorted` to the `MyList` class.
   - Inside the method, use the `sorted()` function to sort the list in ascending order.
   - Print the sorted list.

3. **Example Usage:**
   - In the `__main__` block, create an instance of `MyList` (e.g., my_list).
   - Initialize it with an example list of integers.
   - Print the original list.
   - Call the `print_sorted` method to print the sorted list.

4. **Testing:**
   - Run the script to test the functionality of the `MyList` class.
   - Verify that the original list and the sorted list are printed as expected.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Add docstrings to the class and methods for clear documentation.
   - Include information about the purpose of the class and how to use the `print_sorted` method.

6. **No Import Statements:**
   - Ensure that no import statements are used, as per the requirement.

7. **Version Control:**
   - If you're using version control (e.g., Git), commit the changes to the repository.

8. **Submission:**
   - Submit the 0-my_list.py file for evaluation.

Note: The example usage in the script demonstrates the functionality of the `MyList` class. You can replace it with your own test cases as needed.
