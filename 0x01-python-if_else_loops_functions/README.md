Python - if/else, loops, functions


In Python, if/else statements, loops, and functions are fundamental constructs that allow you to control the flow of your program and organize your code. Here's a brief overview of each:

    if/else Statements:

        Used for conditional execution of code


Loops:

    Loops are used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or executing a block of code repeatedly.

    Two main types of loops in Python: for loop and while loop.



Functions:

    Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.

    They help in modularizing code, making it more readable and maintainable.
