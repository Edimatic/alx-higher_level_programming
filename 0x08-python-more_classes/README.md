				Python - More Classes and Objects


Inheritance:
Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass/base class). It promotes code reuse and allows you to create a hierarchy of classes.


Encapsulation:
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing only what is necessary.


Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects. This can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.


Class Methods and Static Methods:
Besides instance methods, Python supports class methods and static methods. Class methods are methods bound to the class rather than the instance, and static methods are independent of the class and instance.


Properties and Decorators:
Properties allow you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for class attributes. Decorators, such as @property, @classmethod, and @staticmethod, provide a way to modify or extend the behavior of methods.


Magic Methods (Dunder Methods):
Python provides special methods, often referred to as dunder methods (double underscore), that allow you to customize the behavior of your classes. Examples include __init__ for initialization, __str__ for string representation, and __add__ for customizing addition.


Abstract Classes and Interfaces:
Python supports abstract classes through the abc module, allowing you to define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Interfaces can be created using abstract classes with all abstract methods.
