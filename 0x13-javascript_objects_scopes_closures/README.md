# Scope refers to the part of a program where we can access a variable. JavaScript allows us to nest scopes, and variables declared in outer scopes are accessible from all inner ones. Variables can be globally-, module-, or block-scoped.

A closure is a function enclosed with references to the variables in its outer scope. Closures allow functions to maintain connections with outer variables, even outside the scope of the variables.

There are many uses of closures, from creating class-like structures that store state and implement private methods to passing callbacks to event handlers.
