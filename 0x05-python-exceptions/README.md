In Python, exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, an object representing the exception is created, and the normal flow of the program is interrupted. This object, known as an exception object, contains information about the error, such as its type and a message.

Python provides a mechanism for handling exceptions through the use of try, except, else, and finally blocks. Here's a brief explanation of each:


    try: The code that might raise an exception is placed within the "try" block. If an exception occurs within this block, it is caught.


    except: If an exception occurs in the "try" block, the corresponding "except" block is executed. The "except" block specifies the type of exception it can catch. If the type matches the exception that occurred, the code in the "except" block is executed.


    else: The "else" block is optional and is executed if no exception is raised in the "try" block. It is typically used to contain code that should only run when no exceptions occur.


    finally: The "finally" block is optional and is executed whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources, that should be performed regardless of whether an exception occurred.
