			Processes and signals

Processes:
In computing, a process is an independent, self-contained unit of execution that represents the execution of a program. Each process has its own memory space, resources, and execution environment. Processes are managed by the operating system, and they allow multiple tasks or programs to run concurrently. A process typically includes the program code, data, and the execution context. Processes can communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.


Signals:
Signals are software interrupts or notifications sent to a process or to a specific thread within a process to notify it that a specific event has occurred. Signals are a fundamental inter-process communication mechanism in Unix-like operating systems. Signals can be used to request a process to perform a specific action, such as terminating, stopping, or restarting. Common signals include SIGKILL (terminate immediately), SIGTERM (terminate gracefully), and SIGINT (interrupt from the keyboard).


Example of handling signals in a Unix-like shell:
# Sending a termination signal to a process with PID 1234
kill -SIGTERM 1234


Processes and signals play crucial roles in the management and coordination of tasks within an operating system. Understanding these concepts is essential for developing robust and efficient software systems that can handle concurrent execution and respond to various events and conditions.
