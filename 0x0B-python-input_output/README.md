		==================Python - Input/Output=================

In Python, Input/Output (I/O) refers to the process of reading data from an external source (such as a user, file, or network) and writing data back to an external destination. Python provides several built-in functions and modules for handling input and output operations.

Here are some key aspects of Python Input/Output:

Print Statement/Function:
The print() function is used to display information on the standard output (usually the console).

Input Function:
The input() function is used to take user input from the keyboard.

File I/O:
Python allows you to read from and write to files using the open() function and related methods.

Standard Streams:
Python has three standard streams for I/O: sys.stdin (standard input), sys.stdout (standard output), and sys.stderr (standard error).
These streams are commonly used for redirection and handling errors.

Formatted String Output:
Python supports formatted string output using f-strings or the format() method.

Serialization/Deserialization:
The json module in Python is commonly used for serializing (converting to a JSON string) and deserializing (parsing a JSON string) data.

Console Output Formatting:
The format() method and f-strings can be used for formatting output with placeholders and precision.


Understanding and effectively using Python's Input/Output functionalities is crucial for developing applications that interact with users, handle data persistence through files, and communicate with external systems.
