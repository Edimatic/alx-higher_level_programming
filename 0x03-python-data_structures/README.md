Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Lists:
A list in Python is a mutable, ordered sequence of elements. Lists are created by placing comma-separated values inside square brackets []. Lists can contain elements of different data types, including other lists. Elements in a list are indexed starting from 0.

Tuples:

A tuple is an immutable, ordered sequence of elements. Tuples are created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses (). Like lists, tuples can contain elements of different data types.
